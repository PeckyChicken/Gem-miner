# Gem Miner <br>
This is a game which started off as a small project, and gradually as I worked on it it became better and better.
The idea is simple. You have 3 gems to choose from, and you need to place them on the board to make 3 in a row. 
If you make 3 in a row, they get removed, along with any bricks beside them. However, if you do not make 3 in a row on any turn, more bricks will be added.
The goal is to stop the board from filling up.

The current version is under heavy refactorisation, and is not currently functional.
For a functional version, check out [this](https://peckychicken.itch.io/gem-miner) Itch.io page.
